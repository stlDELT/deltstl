                                <p>Once our initial research steps have been completed, we will beging creating wireframes for your website. To start, we will create a user-flow map which will help visualize the journies users will take when browsing your website. This will help us determine how we navigate them to where we want them to be (conversion pages) and how we can convert them (fill out a contact form or schedule a meeting).</p>
                                
                                <p>Once we have the sitemaps and wireframes generated, we can then begin designing the pages. We always start with your website's homepage because this style can then be easily transferred to your interior pages. <b>We offer unlimited design revisions so you are always 100% satisfied with the look of your website before we begin development.</b></p>
                                 
                                 <p>You will recieve access to password-protected software that will allow you to preview your designs in a realistic environment (how they will look in a browser). This software will allow you to comment directly onto the designs so you can give any feedback necessary. </p>
                                
                                <h4>SEO researching and planning</h4>
                                <p>While our designers are working on the website's design, our SEO experts will be researching your industry to determine which keywords should be targeted throughout the website. During this time, they also compile a list of high-volume phrases that can be used for things like blog topics and white papers.</p>
                                 
                                 
                                 <h4>Web development</h4>
                                 <p>We will develop a completely custom, user-friendly framework build on the CMS WordPress. We have experience with several content management systems, but we typically recommend WordPress for business/professional websites.</p>
                                 
                                 <p>When building a WordPress website, we code everything from scratch and never use pre-built themes. We include a minimal amount of files to ensure fast page speeds. Additionally, we include custom scripts that generate lossless compressed images and minified code assets to maximize page speed and reduce server load time.</p>
                                 
                                 <p>Many of the individual elements will be determined upon additional conversations with you, but we will integrate any or all of the following features:</p>
                                 
                                 <li>Google Analytics setup and integration</li>
                                 <li>Calendly, CRM, or other third-party tools integrated into contact forms</li>
                                 <li>Conditional contact forms based on user answers</li>
                                 <li>Surveys and additional forms</li>
                                 <li>Social media feeds</li>

                                 <p>During this development, you will be able to view a live version of your new website on a password-protected URL. This will make it easy for you to track our progress and make any changes you wish.</p>
                                 
                                 <h4>Website launch & hosting</h4>
                                 <p>Once the designs and developed website have been approved we will transfer your website to your primary URL and move it to one of our secure servers.
